# Game piece
all can move into 4 directions, left right up down, they can move as much as they like
defender and attacker have same death -> sandwich between two enemies
king is special death when cornered by 4 attackers or 3 attackers and the throne

# special tiles
thrones = all pieces pass over the throne but only the king can sit on it
tower = act like allie to defender, cant be moved on by attacker or defender, if king moves to tower he wins
